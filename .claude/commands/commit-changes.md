Please analyze my working directory and:

1. Review all modified, added, and deleted files.

2. Group related changes logically (e.g., by feature, fix, refactor, chore, docs, style).

3. Stage the grouped changes.

4. Generate clear, descriptive commit messages following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard (e.g., feat: add user profile page, fix: correct form validation bug).

5. Commit the staged changes in multiple commits if needed, ensuring each commit is atomic and focused.

Confirm that all changes have been committed.
